# Professional Cloud Security Engineer Preparation
This repository contains notes and resources for preparing for the Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer exam. 
The notes are based on the Google Cloud documentation and other resources, and are organized by exam index.
The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the exam content and help you prepare effectively.

> **Note:** After having passed the exam, I can confirm that the notes are accurate and helpful for exam preparation. However,
> expect a lot of questions related to AI scenarios, e.g. Vertex AI, securing ML models, etc.

This repository has been divided into folders following the exam guide. Every folder contains a markdown file with the notes
for that section. It also contains a folder with all the additional resources used to prepare for the exam, including 
links to exam sheets, sample questions, and other relevant materials.
